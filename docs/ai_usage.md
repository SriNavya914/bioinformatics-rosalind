What AI did not do:

It did not write my bioinformatics problem solutions, interpret results, or fabricate data/citations.

My work and verification:

I reviewed all imported cells and edited text/code for correctness and clarity.

I executed the notebook and verified outputs before submission.

All problem-solving steps, interpretations, and conclusions are my own.

How to reproduce:

Open the combined notebook in Google Colab.

Optionally install youtube-transcript-api and attempt transcript retrieval for the two videos (if available).

When finished, use “File → Save a copy in GitHub” and save as notebooks/Bioinformatics_Module03.ipynb.

Limitations and notes:

DOCX extraction preserves text only; formatting such as tables or images may be simplified.

YouTube transcripts may be unavailable for some videos; helper code is optional.

Any boilerplate inserted by AI was reviewed and kept only if relevant.

Academic integrity statement:

AI assistance was limited to file organization, formatting, and consolidation. All solutions, analysis, and conclusions are written by me and reflect my understanding of the material.
